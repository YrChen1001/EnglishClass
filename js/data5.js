<p>Dear Mr. Keel,</p>
<p>I am writing to confirm your group photography session at 10:00 A.M. on Saturday. As discussed, this photo shoot will take place at your restaurant, and I will photograph your staff along the wall in the main dining hall. You mentioned that your waitstaff will need to start getting ready for the day at 10:30 A.M., and that should not be a problem. The shoot should be finished by 10:30 A.M.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise I will see you on Saturday!</p>

<p><strong>Article: Bistro Pleases</strong></p>
<p>Enter Bentonside Bistro any day for lunch or dinner, and you'll hear the sounds of clinking forks and chattering patrons. "That's the sound of happy diners," says Herman Keel, the restaurant's owner.</p>
<p>Opened two years ago, the bistro has exceeded expectations. The menu features traditional Irish dishes prepared by chef Deirdre Hanrahan. She notes, "We choose ingredients that are at the height of summer, fall, winter, and spring, and showcase these on our menu."</p>
<p>On a recent Wednesday afternoon, Jacinta Coelho, a visitor from Brazil, was dining at the bistro. "I can't get over the freshness and homemade taste!" exclaimed Ms. Coelho. "It's like the chef went outside and selected the ingredients just for me."</p>
<p>Bentonside Bistro is located at 1644 Bentonside Road and is open Tuesday through Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. The interior is painted in bright shades of blue reminiscent of the ocean, with a rotating gallery of artwork adorning the walls. The staff is friendly and the delicious food is reasonably priced. Reservations are not required.</p>

<p>Keel 先生您好：</p>
<p>我寫信確認週六上午 10:00 的團體攝影。誠如討論，這次拍攝將在您的餐廳進行，我將拍攝您的員工站在主餐廳牆邊的樣子。您提到您的外場服務生需要在 10:30 開始準備當天的工作，這應該沒問題。拍攝應會在 10:30 結束。</p>
<p>如有疑問請告知。否則週六見！</p>

<p><strong>報導：小酒館令人滿意</strong></p>
<p>任何一天午餐或晚餐走進 Bentonside Bistro，你都會聽到叉子碰撞和顧客交談的聲音。「那是快樂食客的聲音，」餐廳老闆 Herman Keel 說。</p>
<p>這家小酒館開幕兩年，表現超出預期。菜單主打由主廚 Deirdre Hanrahan 準備的傳統愛爾蘭菜餚。她指出：「我們選擇夏、秋、冬、春當季盛產的食材，並在菜單上呈現。」</p>
<p>在最近一個週三下午，來自巴西的遊客 Jacinta Coelho 正在此用餐。「我對這新鮮度和家常風味讚嘆不已！」Coelho 女士驚呼。「就像主廚走到外面專門為我挑選食材一樣。」</p>
<p>Bentonside Bistro 位於 1644 Bentonside Road，周二至周六上午 11:30 至晚上 9:00 開放。內部漆成讓人聯想到海洋的明亮藍色，牆上裝飾著旋轉的藝術作品。員工親切，食物美味合理。預約非必需。</p>
